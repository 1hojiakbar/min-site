          Denzel Hayes Washington, Jr. was born on December 28, 1954 in Mount
          Vernon, New York. He is the middle of three children of a beautician
          mother, Lennis, from Georgia, and a Pentecostal minister father,
          Denzel Washington, Sr., from Virginia. After graduating from high
          school, Denzel enrolled at Fordham University, intent on a career in
          journalism. However, he caught the acting bug while appearing in
          student drama productions and, upon graduation, he moved to San
          Francisco and enrolled at the American Conservatory Theater. He left
          A.C.T. after only one year to seek work as an actor. His first paid
          acting role was in a summer stock theater stage production in St.
          Mary's City, Maryland. The play was "Wings of the Morning", which is
          about the founding of the colony of Maryland (now the state of
          Maryland) and the early days of the Maryland colonial assembly (a
          legislative body). He played the part of a real historical character,
          Mathias Da Sousa, although much of the dialogue was created.
          Afterwards he began to pursue screen roles in earnest. With his acting
          versatility and powerful presence, he had no difficulty finding work
          in numerous television productions.
